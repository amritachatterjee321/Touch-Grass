# Firebase Collections Setup Guide

## 🎯 Complete Collections Creation for EventBuddy

Your Firebase database needs **8 collections** to support the full EventBuddy functionality. This can be done automatically or manually.

---

## 🚀 **AUTOMATIC METHOD (Recommended)**

### **Your App Will Create Collections Automatically**

Your app is already configured to create collections automatically when you:

1. **Start your development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Check browser console** for initialization messages:
   ```
   🚀 Initializing EventBuddy Database...
   📂 Creating categories collection...
   🏙️ Creating cities collection...
   📊 Collections created: categories, cities, achievements, users, quests, chats, messages, notifications
   ✅ Database initialization completed
   ```

---

## 🔧 **MANUAL METHOD** (Alternative)

### If automatic setup doesn't work, run manually:
<｜tool▁calls▁begin｜><｜tool▁call▁begin｜>
run_terminal_cmd
